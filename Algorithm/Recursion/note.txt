Recursion
calling the same function within iself.
function inception() {
   inception();
}

will result in stack overflow due to continuous calling without popping.
Therefore require a base case
1. Identify the base case.
2. Identify the recursive case.
3. Get closer and closer and return when needed. usually there is 2 returns.

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,  8,  9
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

when to use recursion:

traversing or converting something into a tree.
1. Divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2. Each instances of the subproblem is identical in nature.
3. The solution of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand.
