Sorting

.sort method is not the solution for function with larger imput.
scalable sorting algorithm is required for large input.
JS sorts by lokking up string unicode points. So sorting numbers might be inaccurate.
also sort function time complexity is dependent on browsers (due to their compile engine)

elementary sort = bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort
O(nlog(n)) - divide and conquer with recursion
