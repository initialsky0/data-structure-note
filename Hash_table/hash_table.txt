Hash Table - object in JS, or dictionary in Python

store both key and value.
input -> hash function -> address
Hash function is one way, same output for same input, but cannot reverse to get input. -> idempotent

hash table have possibility of collision (assigning data to same address)
collision slows down reading and writing causeing it to be O(n)
method to deal with collision is using linked lists
