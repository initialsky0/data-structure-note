Stacks + Queues
No random acess, only can modify start or end items

Stacks - like plates stacking
Last in first out - LIFO
functions follows stack -> execute one by one
fairly ok to implement with array or linkedlist

Queues - like a line to enter
First in first out - FIFO
ideally done with linkedlist
